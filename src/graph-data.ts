/**
 * graph-data.ts — The service graph
 *
 * Three data structures make up the graph:
 *
 *   NODES       — every government service, deduplicated across life events
 *   EDGES       — typed relationships between services
 *   LIFE_EVENTS — the 13 entry points into the graph (one per life event)
 *
 * Edge types:
 *   REQUIRES → strict ordering; the source must be completed before the target
 *   ENABLES  → the source makes the target accessible or relevant
 *
 * Life events don't appear in the graph themselves — they just point to a
 * set of entry nodes (the services directly triggered by that event).
 * The traversal engine handles discovering everything downstream.
